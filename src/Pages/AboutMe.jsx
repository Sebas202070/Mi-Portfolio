          Hello!! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Sebastian, I am from Posadas, Misiones and Lic,
          in business administration, but the twists and turns of life led me to
          study programming, and with much effort and dedication I recently
          graduated as a Full Stack Developer in Henry, where I received my
          greatest learning in new technologies (libraries and frameworks) with
          more than 700 hours of code in Javascript. I also have excellent
          English and experience working in a team. I really want to be able to
          work, develop and add as a programmer in the place or the company that
          allows me to apply everything I have learned and all my knowledge! Do
          not hesitate to contact me and arrange an interview! Best regards!!
          Sebastian
